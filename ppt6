Here’s a PowerPoint outline for Ansible Modules that includes definitions and common modules like fetch and SCP.

Slide 1: Introduction to Ansible Modules

What is an Ansible Module?

A module is a piece of code that Ansible executes on remote systems to perform tasks.

It abstracts system-specific operations, such as copying files, managing packages, or configuring services.

Modules can be written in various languages, but most are written in Python.

Modules are idempotent, meaning running them multiple times won’t cause unintended side effects.

Slide 2: Structure of an Ansible Module

1. Name: Each module has a name (e.g., copy, file, apt).


2. Arguments: Modules accept parameters (e.g., file paths, user names, etc.).


3. Return Values: Modules return JSON data indicating success or failure.



Example:

- name: Copy a file to remote server
  copy:
    src: /local/path/file.txt
    dest: /remote/path/file.txt

Slide 3: Common Ansible Modules

1. File Module (file)

Manages file properties (permissions, ownership, etc.).

Example: Change permissions of a file.


- name: Ensure file is present with specific permissions
  file:
    path: /etc/myfile
    mode: '0644'

2. Copy Module (copy)

Copies files from local to remote systems.

Example: Copy a file from local machine to remote server.


- name: Copy a file to remote server
  copy:
    src: /local/path/file.txt
    dest: /remote/path/file.txt

3. Fetch Module (fetch)

Retrieves files from remote systems to local systems.

Example: Fetch a file from a remote system.


- name: Fetch a log file from remote server
  fetch:
    src: /remote/path/file.log
    dest: /local/path/

4. SCP Module (scp)

Securely copies files from one server to another over SSH.

Example: Copy a file from one remote server to another.


- name: Copy file from one remote server to another using SCP
  scp:
    src: /path/to/source/file.txt
    dest: user@destination:/path/to/destination/file.txt


---

Slide 4: Detailed Example of fetch Module

The fetch module is used to retrieve files from a remote server to the local machine running the Ansible playbook.


Example:

- name: Fetch logs from remote server
  fetch:
    src: /var/log/application.log
    dest: /tmp/application_logs/
    flat: yes

src: Path of the file on the remote server.

dest: Local path to store the fetched file.

flat: If yes, it will store the file directly in the destination directory without creating subdirectories.



---

Slide 5: Detailed Example of SCP Module

The scp module helps in copying files between remote servers using SSH.

Prerequisite: SSH must be enabled and configured.


Example:

- name: Copy a file from one remote server to another using SCP
  scp:
    src: /tmp/file_to_copy.txt
    dest: user@remote_server:/tmp/destination/
    mode: push

src: The source file path.

dest: The destination path on the target server.

mode: Defines the direction of copy (push or pull).

Slide 6: Other Common Ansible Modules

1. Yum Module (yum)

Manages packages on RPM-based systems (e.g., CentOS, RHEL).

Example:

- name: Install nginx
  yum:
    name: nginx
    state: present



2. Service Module (service)

Manages services on a remote machine.

Example:

- name: Ensure nginx is running
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started



3. Command Module (command)

Executes commands on remote systems.

Example:

- name: Run a custom command
  command: /path/to/script.sh



4. Git Module (git)

Manages git repositories on remote systems.

Example:

- name: Clone a git repository
  git:
    repo: 'https://github.com/username/repo.git'
    dest: /path/to/destination/

Slide 7: Summary of Ansible Modules

Ansible Modules are reusable building blocks for automating tasks.

They are idempotent and help abstract system-specific operations.

Common modules include:

file: Manage file properties.

copy: Copy files to/from remote systems.

fetch: Retrieve files from remote servers.

scp: Copy files securely between remote servers.


Modules help improve automation, efficiency, and ensure consistency across multiple systems.
