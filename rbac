The three components—ServiceAccount, ClusterRole, and RoleBinding—are all part of Kubernetes' RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system, which is used for managing access to cluster resources. However, there isn't a single, formal term that encompasses just these three specific components. They are all integral to the RBAC configuration in Kubernetes, so a broader term that could be used is:

"Kubernetes RBAC Configuration for Access Control"

This title encapsulates the setup and management of ServiceAccounts, Roles (and ClusterRoles), and RoleBindings within the context of controlling access to Kubernetes resources.
