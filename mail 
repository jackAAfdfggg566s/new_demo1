Subject: Progress Update on English Communication Improvement

Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I would like to provide an update on my progress since our last discussion regarding improving my English communication skills.

In addition to sticking with my previous learning plan, I have added the following activities to further enhance my English proficiency:

1. Toastmasters Club: I have started attending the Toastmasters speech club, which has been a great opportunity to practice public speaking and improve my verbal communication skills in English.


2. TAFE Enrollment: I have successfully registered for a course at TAFE. However, the classes are currently on break and will commence in February, so I am preparing for that.


3. Church Meetings: I have been actively participating in church gatherings, which are conducted in English. This has provided me with opportunities to engage in conversations and improve my listening and speaking skills.


4. Local News & Talk Shows: I have been regularly listening to local news and watching talk shows, which helps me improve my understanding of the language and familiarize myself with various accents and expressions.



I am committed to continuing these efforts and will keep you updated on my progress. Please let me know if you have any further suggestions or feedback.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
