以下是一个适合用于年终总结的英文段落，强调你以市场为导向，理解交易系统的重要性，并基于业务背景制定和优化测试方案的价值导向表达：

"With a market-first mindset, I recognized the critical importance of the trading system to business operations. Focusing on the AMO (After Market Orders) module, I proactively studied relevant non-functional requirements (NFRs) and financial context. This understanding enabled me to design and optimize test strategies that aligned with both technical expectations and business priorities, ensuring the system’s performance, stability, and reliability under real-world market conditions."
