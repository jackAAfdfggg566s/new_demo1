Certainly! Here's a clear English description of how to use FIS, SSM, and EC2 to simulate NLB register/deregister operations:

Simulating NLB Target Deregistration and Registration Using AWS FIS, SSM, and EC2

To simulate the impact of an EC2 instance being removed from and re-added to a Network Load Balancer (NLB) target group, we use AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS) in combination with AWS Systems Manager (SSM) and EC2.

1. FIS initiates the experiment and uses a predefined execution role with ssm:SendCommand permissions.


2. SSM is used to remotely run shell commands on the target EC2 instance.


3. The EC2 instance executes AWS CLI commands to deregister itself from the NLB target group and optionally re-register after a delay.



This setup isolates permissions and follows the principle of least privilege:

FIS only has permissions to invoke SSM commands.

The EC2 instance role contains the necessary elasticloadbalancing:DeregisterTargets and RegisterTargets permissions.


This design ensures that FIS cannot directly affect the load balancer or other resources, reducing the blast radius and improving security.
