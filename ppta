Here's a breakdown of how the slide would look in a PPT format:


---

Slide 7: Ansible Inventory & Basic Commands

Ansible Inventory

Static Inventory:

A simple text file listing hosts and groups.

Dynamic Inventory:

Uses scripts or APIs to dynamically generate host lists.

Example command (AWS dynamic inventory):

ansible -i ec2.py all -m ping

This slide combines Ansible Inventory and Basic Commands, making it easy to understand their usage and integration. You can now create a PowerPoint slide based on this content.

If you'd like, I can also help you create a PPT file. Just let me know!
