Here’s the English translation of your statement with clear technical language:


---

Granting these permissions directly to users is not secure, as they are highly privileged. Therefore, the permissions are now assigned to a dedicated EC2 instance instead. This EC2 instance only allows access via AWS Systems Manager (SSM) and does not permit SSH access. For this reason, a new EC2 instance is provisioned specifically for fault injection, rather than using the existing bastion host.
