当然，这是加上“根据不同阶段项目目标制定计划”的优化版本：


---

"Defined the big-picture strategy for the testing project and developed tailored plans aligned with project goals at each stage. Focused on continuous improvement by optimizing test processes, enhancing automation pipelines, and refining monitoring dashboards. Collected and applied team feedback to iterate on tools and workflows, resulting in significantly improved testing efficiency and delivery quality."
