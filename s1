GitLab CI/CD Basic Concepts - Presentation Script

1. What is CI/CD?

CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment) are key practices in modern software development. They aim to improve the speed and quality of software development, testing, and release through automation.

Continuous Integration (CI): Developers frequently integrate code into a shared repository, and every commit triggers automated builds, tests, and deployment processes. The goal is to identify and fix issues early.

Continuous Delivery (CD): Continuous Delivery automates the release of code to a pre-production environment, ensuring that code is always in a deployable state.

Continuous Deployment (CD): An extension of Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment automatically deploys code to production after it passes all tests.


2. Introduction to GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD is a solution for continuous integration and continuous delivery offered by GitLab. It is fully integrated into the GitLab platform and helps teams automate the processes of building, testing, deploying, and releasing software.

Key Features:

Version Control: Based on Git, GitLab provides version control, code merging, and branching.

Automated Pipelines: Automates the build, test, and deploy workflows.

Parallel Jobs: Supports parallel execution of multiple jobs, reducing pipeline execution time.

Continuous Deployment and Delivery: Automates deployment to different environments to ensure smooth software quality and release.

Extensibility: Integrates with other tools (such as Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, etc.) to extend functionality.


3. GitLab CI/CD Structure

GitLab CI/CD workflows are defined in a .gitlab-ci.yml file, which is located at the root of the repository. This file contains all the pipeline configuration.

Main Components:

1. Pipeline: A pipeline is the entire CI/CD process, consisting of stages and jobs.


2. Stages: Stages divide the pipeline into different steps. Each stage contains multiple jobs. Common stages include build, test, deploy, etc.


3. Jobs: Jobs are the specific tasks in each stage, such as running tests, building applications, etc.


4. Runners: GitLab Runners are independent programs responsible for executing the jobs defined in the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.


5. Artifacts: Artifacts are files generated during job execution. They can be passed on to subsequent jobs or saved for later use or download.


6. Variables: Variables allow dynamic configuration of values in the CI/CD pipeline, such as environment variables.



4. Core Concepts in GitLab CI/CD

1. .gitlab-ci.yml File: The .gitlab-ci.yml file is the heart of GitLab CI/CD configuration. It defines the pipeline, stages, jobs, and how they execute. Here is an example structure:

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project"
    - make

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests"
    - make test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying the project"
    - make deploy


2. Stages:

A stage groups jobs together into a sequence. Common stages in GitLab CI/CD pipelines include build, test, deploy, etc.

Each stage is executed in sequence, meaning one stage will not start until the previous one finishes.



3. Jobs:

Jobs are the actual tasks in each stage. Jobs can run scripts, commands, or other operations necessary for the pipeline.

Jobs can be dependent on previous jobs, meaning they will only run if the prior job in the pipeline succeeds.



4. GitLab Runners:

A GitLab Runner is an agent that listens for jobs and executes them on your machine or a container. Runners can be hosted by GitLab or self-managed on your own infrastructure.

You can use different types of runners, such as Shell, Docker, Kubernetes, etc., depending on your environment.



5. Artifacts:

Artifacts are files generated by a job that can be passed to another job or stored for later use. For example, build artifacts like JAR files or test results can be stored and used in subsequent jobs.



6. Variables:

GitLab CI/CD supports the use of variables to dynamically pass configuration data such as environment settings, API keys, or other sensitive information. Variables can be defined in the .gitlab-ci.yml file or set globally in GitLab settings.




5. Basic GitLab CI/CD Concepts Explained

1. Pipeline:

A pipeline is the complete CI/CD process. It consists of multiple stages and jobs that execute in a defined sequence.



2. Stages:

Stages group jobs into logical units of work. For example, you might have a build stage that compiles code, followed by a test stage to run unit tests, and then a deploy stage to release the application.



3. Jobs:

A job is a task that GitLab Runner executes. Each job has a specific script (commands to run) and can be configured to run on certain runners.



4. Runners:

Runners are the workers that execute the jobs in your pipeline. You can use shared runners provided by GitLab, or you can set up your own private runners.



5. Artifacts:

Artifacts are files that are generated during a job's execution and can be shared between jobs in the same pipeline. You can configure jobs to save artifacts, like logs, test results, and build files.



6. Variables:

Variables are used to store configuration values that can be reused in multiple jobs. For example, you can define the database credentials or deployment target as environment variables.




6. A Simple GitLab CI/CD Example

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  DATABASE_URL: "https://database.example.com"

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the project"
    - make build

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests"
    - make test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying to production"
    - make deploy

Stages are defined: build, test, deploy.

Each stage contains a job that has a specific script.

Variables like DATABASE_URL are defined at the top and can be used in jobs.


7. Conclusion

GitLab CI/CD enables teams to automate the entire software development lifecycle, from building and testing to deployment. By using .gitlab-ci.yml, you define the workflow of your CI/CD pipeline, configure jobs, and specify variables, stages, and runners. This automation leads to faster development cycles, more reliable software releases, and improved collaboration between team members.
