下面给你一段专业、清晰、可直接发给团队/审计/领导的英文说明，你可以整体复制使用，也可以按需要微调 👇
Suggested English explanation
“We believe this combined-failure approach is better than rebooting all three instances simultaneously. Rebooting all instances at once simulates a total cluster outage, which is unrealistic and provides limited learning value because it does not reflect how failures actually occur in production. It also prevents us from observing failover behavior, traffic rerouting, and application resilience under partial degradation.
Our proposed approach more closely mirrors real-world scenarios: we trigger a true Aurora writer failover while intentionally degrading one reader instance, leaving one instance healthy as a control. This allows us to validate that (1) automatic failover works as expected, (2) the application can continue operating with reduced cluster capacity, and (3) our retry, load balancing, and connection handling mechanisms behave correctly during mixed healthy/unhealthy states. Overall, this approach provides deeper, more actionable reliability insights than rebooting all instances simultaneously.”
如果你想要更短的版本（适合 Slack/邮件一句话）
“The combined failover + partial reader failure approach is more realistic and informative than rebooting all three instances at once, because it tests true failover behavior while validating system resilience under partial, rather than total, cluster failure.”
如果你告诉我发给谁（比如：经理、SRE团队、审计、产品），我可以帮你改成更正式 / 更技术 / 更简洁的语气。
