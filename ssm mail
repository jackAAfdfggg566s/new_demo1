Subject: Proposed Secure Architecture for FIS-Based Network Experiments

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I’d like to share our proposed approach for safely simulating network behavior using AWS Fault Injection Simulator (FIS), without introducing unnecessary security risks.

Instead of granting sensitive permissions (e.g., deregistering targets from a Network Load Balancer or modifying network ACLs) directly to users or to a general-purpose bastion host, we’ve designed a more secure and isolated architecture:

A dedicated EC2 instance is provisioned specifically for running fault injection commands.

This instance is assigned an IAM role with tightly scoped permissions, such as elasticloadbalancing:DeregisterTargets or ec2:ReplaceNetworkAclEntry.

The EC2 instance does not allow SSH access and is only accessible via AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

All commands are triggered remotely via FIS using the aws:ssm:send-command action.

The FIS execution role itself is limited to only calling SSM commands, minimizing its blast radius.


This architecture ensures:

Sensitive permissions are isolated to a controlled EC2 environment.

Users and bastion hosts do not hold elevated permissions.

All activity is auditable via SSM and CloudTrail.


Please let me know if you'd like a diagram or example experiment template to support implementation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
