Subject: Thank You for Your Feedback

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

Thank you for our conversation last week regarding areas for improvement, particularly in my English and communication skills. I truly appreciate the opportunity to recognize these areas and work on them.

As you know, I come from a non-English speaking country, and sometimes the cultural differences have led me to focus more on completing tasks than engaging in open communication. However, I’m now fully committed to integrating into the Australian culture and embracing more open sharing.

Over the past three months, I have focused on familiarizing myself with the company structure, documentation, and completing my tasks while reflecting on project progress. I believe now is the right time to focus on improving my communication skills.

To improve, I have considered the following actions:

Speak English every day and engage more with colleagues, even practicing English at home with my wife instead of speaking Chinese.

Take LinkedIn Learning courses focused on communication and small talk.

Use English learning apps like “FluentU” for daily practice.

Enroll in TAFE to further improve my English skills.

Participate in company events like the coffee roulette to engage more with the team.

I hope to have the opportunity to do technical sharing with colleagues, such as on automation topics.

I would appreciate any additional feedback or guidance you may have.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
