Subject: Thank You and Request for Feedback on Improving Communication Skills

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I would like to sincerely thank you for the conversation we had last week regarding the areas I need to improve, particularly my English language and communication skills. I truly appreciate the opportunity to understand these areas for growth and the chance to work on them.

As you know, I come from a non-English speaking country, and I’ve found that the cultural differences sometimes lead me to focus more on getting the work done rather than engaging in active communication. However, I am now fully committed to embracing and integrating into the Australian culture, which encourages more sharing and open communication.

Over the past three months, I have been primarily focused on familiarizing myself with the company’s structure, processes, and documentation, while also completing my assigned tasks and reflecting on various project situations. Now, I believe this is a good opportunity to actively focus on improving my communication skills, both in English and in terms of interpersonal communication within the team.

I would greatly appreciate your guidance and feedback on the following suggestions for improvement:

Structured Learning: Should I consider enrolling in a formal English communication course to help refine my skills?
Regular Feedback: Would it be helpful for me to schedule regular check-ins with you or a mentor to discuss my progress and receive feedback on my communication?
Team Interaction: Are there specific areas or strategies you recommend for improving my engagement with the team and contributing more effectively in meetings?
Cultural Awareness: Any suggestions on how I can better understand the communication style and cultural expectations within the team and the broader organization?
Once again, thank you for your valuable feedback, and I would really appreciate any advice or thoughts you could share. I am looking forward to taking the necessary steps to improve and contribute more effectively to the team.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
