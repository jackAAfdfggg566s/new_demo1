明白了，你的意思是避免在跳板机（bastion host）本身上配置权限来发送 SSM 命令，而是选择更安全的方式，比如通过本地或 CI/CD 系统授权来执行命令。以下是精准表达这一点的英文句子：

专业版（适用于年终总结）：

"When designing the experiment, I prioritized security by avoiding assigning permissions to the bastion host itself to send SSM commands. Instead, I used a more secure approach by granting the necessary IAM permissions to a centralized and controlled execution environment. I also facilitated discussions with the team to evaluate the security implications of different options."

更简洁版本：

> "To ensure security, I avoided granting SSM execution permissions to the bastion host. Instead, permissions were managed through a secure and centralized environment, and I shared risk comparisons with the team across alternative approaches."

如需整合到一段完整的“设计 + 安全 + 沟通”内容里，也可以告诉我，我帮你写成段落。
