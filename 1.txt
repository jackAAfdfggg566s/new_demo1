这句话可以表达为一个专业、流畅的英文句子，用于总结最佳实践（Best Practices）方面的经验：

正式版（适合年终总结）：

"Followed best practices in GitLab for managing secrets by using secure, centrally available variables. Ensured that sensitive information such as passwords and access keys was regularly updated and masked during test log exports."

更详细版本：

如需添加你使用的工具（如 GitLab CI/CD、Vault 等）或具体做法（定期轮换、加密存储），我也可以进一步完善这段内容。
