Risk Management

As part of the AWS cloud migration project, I played a key role in identifying, assessing, and monitoring risks from a testing and reliability engineering perspective. Several notable risk scenarios were proactively addressed to ensure a smooth transition and high system resilience:

1. Connectivity Failures
We identified the risk of intermittent or lost connections between EC2 instances and RDS databases, especially due to misconfigured security groups. This was assessed as high impact and was mitigated by refining inbound rules and conducting fault injection experiments using custom scripts.


2. Data Integrity During Migration
The risk of data loss or corruption during database migration was evaluated. We implemented data validation checks, checksum comparisons, and ran automated test suites covering over 180 test cases, ensuring data integrity throughout the migration process.


3. Performance Degradation Post-Migration
Potential performance bottlenecks due to new cloud-based configurations were identified and stress-tested using automated load tests. Metrics such as CPU, RTO, AE/AR, and application logs were monitored through custom dashboards to catch anomalies in real time.


4. Single Point of Failure in Load Balancing
To test system reliability, we simulated NLB disconnection scenarios not supported natively by AWS FIS, using custom automation scripts. This helped uncover configuration weaknesses and validate fallback mechanisms.


5. Security Exposure from Broad Network Rules
We reviewed overly permissive security group rules and transitioned from IP range-based access to fine-grained, instance-specific permissions. This minimized the attack surface and supported controlled failure experiments (e.g., MI app disconnection tests).



All risks were tracked using a structured risk register and integrated into our continuous testing pipeline, allowing for early detection and mitigation throughout the migration lifecycle.
