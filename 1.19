Configuring AWS CLI Access Key

The aws configure set accesskey command is used to configure the AWS CLI with an access key that allows you to interact with AWS services from your local machine. By setting the access key, you enable the AWS CLI to authenticate API requests made to AWS services on your behalf.

Purpose:

The purpose of this operation is to securely store your AWS access key in the AWS CLI configuration, ensuring that the AWS CLI can authenticate requests and perform actions on AWS resources. This is essential for automating tasks, managing infrastructure, or performing operations programmatically.

Steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.


2. Use the following command to set your AWS access key:

aws configure set aws_access_key_id YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID


3. Replace YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID with your actual AWS access key ID.


4. This will securely save the access key to your AWS CLI configuration file, enabling you to run subsequent AWS commands without needing to input the access key manually.
