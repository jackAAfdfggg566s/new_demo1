好，我给你一版Jira defect用的英文示例，包含标题 + 描述内容，偏技术、偏正式，适合直接贴到 Jira 里 👇
（我也给你一个稍微“轻一点”的标题备选）
Title (Defect)
Missing Pod Ephemeral Storage Limit Caused Node Resource Exhaustion and Pod Evictions
Alternative (shorter):
Pod Without Disk Limit Led to Node Resource Pressure and Evictions
Description
Issue Summary
It was identified that the pod was not configured with an ephemeral storage (disk) limit.
During testing, a single pod continuously consumed disk space, which resulted in node-level resource pressure.
Impact
Excessive disk usage by one pod caused the node to enter a resource low state
Kubernetes triggered pod evictions on the affected node
Other healthy pods on the same node were impacted, even though they were not the source of the issue
Root Cause
The pod specification did not define ephemeral-storage limits
Without disk constraints, the test workload was able to consume node disk resources unchecked
Node-level disk pressure led to eviction decisions by kubelet
Expected Behavior
Pods should have appropriate ephemeral storage requests and limits configured
Excessive disk usage should be contained within the pod itself, without impacting the entire node
Proposed Fix / Recommendation
Define ephemeral-storage requests and limits for all pods
Add validation or policy (e.g. admission controller / policy check) to prevent pods without disk limits from being deployed
Update testing guidelines to avoid running unbounded disk consumption workloads on shared nodes
如果你要的是：
更偏事故复盘（Incident-style）
更偏测试缺陷（Test caused issue）
或者想弱化“人为测试导致”的语气
我可以再帮你改一版更“好过 review / 不容易被追责”的 Jira 描述 😄
