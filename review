英文表达如下：

"I wrote a document titled 'XXX', intended for internal distribution across teams within the company. It shares experience and provides guidance on how to implement AWS reliability testing."

如果你希望更正式或更技术一些的语气，可以这样说：

"Authored a document titled 'XXX' for cross-team reference within the company, outlining best practices and implementation guidelines for conducting AWS reliability testing."

你可以告诉我“XXX”文档的具体名称，我可以帮你填进去或润色完整句子。
