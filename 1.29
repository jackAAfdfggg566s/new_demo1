好，这里我直接按你给的 DR / 手动恢复背景，给你一份完整、可直接创建的 Jira Task（英文）。内容已经明确：

PostgreSQL duplicate sequence 是 root cause
Playbook 是 DR 场景

Title
Create DR Playbook for Manual Data Recovery After DB Restart Experiment (PostgreSQL Duplicate Sequence)
Description
Background
During a database restart experiment, three database instances were restarted.
The restart triggered a data loss scenario, where some records:
Failed to be persisted in PostgreSQL
Were successfully produced to Kafka, but ended up in the Kafka error topic
The root cause was identified as PostgreSQL duplicate sequence, which caused insert failures after the database restart.
This issue is tracked in the existing defect:
➡️ Related Defect: [DEFECT-XXX]
Problem Statement
This scenario represents a Disaster Recovery (DR) case that requires manual intervention.
Currently, there is no documented playbook describing:
How to enter DR mode after a restart experiment
How to fix PostgreSQL duplicate sequence issues safely
How to manually recover missing data from Kafka error topics
How to validate data consistency before exiting DR mode
The lack of a standardized playbook increases recovery time and operational risk during experiments and real incidents.
Task Objective
Create a DR Playbook that documents manual data recovery procedures for data loss triggered by database restart experiments, with PostgreSQL duplicate sequence as the root cause.
Scope / Deliverables
The playbook should clearly document:
DR Trigger & Entry Criteria
When to declare DR mode
Signals from DB restart experiments and Kafka error topics
Impact Assessment
How to identify missing records in PostgreSQL
How to determine affected Kafka topics, partitions, and offsets
Root Cause Fix
How to validate PostgreSQL sequence vs table max ID
Manual sequence realignment steps
Manual Data Recovery
Using Kafka error topic as the recovery source
Controlled replay strategy (manual execution, idempotent writes)
Audit and traceability requirements
Post-Recovery Validation
Data consistency checks
Kafka error topic and consumer lag verification
Exit DR Mode
Criteria to resume normal traffic
Monitoring and verification steps

Links to dashboards, scripts, or runbooks (if available)
Acceptance Criteria
A DR playbook is created and reviewed
Playbook explicitly states manual recovery is required
Playbook is linked to the related defect
On-call engineers can follow the playbook during DB restart experiments
