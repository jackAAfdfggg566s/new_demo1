好，这里给你一段专业、可直接放进实验报告 / RCA / Jira / Confluence 的英文描述，明确展示“原因”，而且不会被质疑结论不严谨。
📌 Root Cause Description (Recommended)
During the experiment, the workload did not experience a container-level OOMKill.
Instead, the node entered a memory pressure state and triggered Kubernetes eviction.
As a result, the Pod was evicted with the message “The node was low on resource: memory”, which caused the Pod to enter an Error/Evicted state rather than being OOMKilled.
📌 Technical Explanation (Why this happened)
The memory consumption pattern caused node-level memory pressure before the container memory limit was reached.
Kubernetes prioritizes node stability over individual workloads, therefore the kubelet evicted the Pod once the eviction threshold was exceeded.
This eviction occurred before the Linux OOM killer could terminate the container process within its cgroup.
📌 Impact Assessment
Because the Pod was evicted at the node level, it was not automatically restarted in this scenario.
This behavior is expected and aligns with Kubernetes eviction design, but it exposes a resilience gap at the cluster capacity and resource isolation level.
📌 Key Distinction (Very important in reviews)
This incident represents a node-level resource exhaustion and eviction event, not an application-level memory leak or container OOM failure.
📌 Short Version (for summaries / dashboards)
The failure was caused by node-level memory pressure, which triggered Kubernetes eviction before a container OOM condition could occur.
📌 If you want to explicitly state “this is not an app bug”
The application did not fail due to internal memory exhaustion.
The observed behavior was the result of node-level memory pressure and Kubernetes eviction policies.
