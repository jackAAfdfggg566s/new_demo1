好，我帮你把**“去了斐济、目前滞留在那边”这个情况自然、不过度暴露隐私、对移民局友好**地加进去。
下面这版语气是：事实说明 + 强调需要尽快回澳洲上班，不会显得是个人原因拖延。

Request for Employment Confirmation Letter to Support Urgent Return to Australia
Dear [Manager/HR Name],
I hope you are well.
I am writing to kindly request your assistance with a short letter/email confirming my employment and the need for me to return to Australia as soon as possible to resume my duties.
I travelled to Fiji recently and, due to visa-related processing currently underway, I am temporarily unable to return to Australia and have been staying in Fiji while awaiting the outcome. An officer from the Department of Home Affairs has advised that a confirmation from my employer stating that my return to Australia is required for work may assist in prioritising and expediting the assessment.
If possible, could the letter/email please include:
Confirmation of my employment with [Company Name]
My position/title
A statement that I am required to return to Australia as soon as possible to continue my role
(Optional) Any business impact if my return is further delayed
The letter can be brief and sent by email. An official company email or letterhead would be greatly appreciated.
Thank you very much for your understanding and support. Please let me know if you need any further information from me.
Kind regards,
Jack C
[Your Job Title]
[Company Name]

给你一个更“稳妥”的说法说明
用的是 “travelled to Fiji / temporarily unable to return”
没说“个人原因”“签证问题细节”，不容易被移民局误解
把重点放在：公司需要你回去上班
如果你愿意，我还能帮你：
✉️ 改成 公司直接写给移民局的版本
📄 写成 PDF证明信（更正式）
🧾 帮你配一段 你提交给移民局的个人解释说明（statement）
你可以直接说：**“我要给谁看？HR 还是移民局？”**我帮你再精修一版。
