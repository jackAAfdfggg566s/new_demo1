Subject: Thank You for Your Feedback

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

Thank you for our conversation last week regarding areas for improvement, particularly in my English and communication skills. I truly appreciate the opportunity to recognize these areas and work on them.

As you know, I come from a non-English speaking country, and sometimes the cultural differences have led me to focus more on completing tasks than engaging in open communication. However, Iâ€™m now fully committed to integrating into the Australian culture and embracing more open sharing.

Over the past three months, I have focused on familiarizing myself with the company structure, documentation, and completing my tasks while reflecting on project progress. I believe now is the right time to focus on improving my communication skills, and I would greatly appreciate any further advice or guidance you can offer.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
