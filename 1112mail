Subject: Request to Create Firewall Rule for N2 Environment DB Pipeline

Hi [Team/Name],

We would like to request a new firewall (FW) rule to support the GitLab agent for our N2 environment DB pipeline.

Details:

Source: GitLab agent (N2 environment)

Destination: [please fill in target system or IPs]

Purpose: To enable the DB pipeline to connect and operate correctly in the N2 environment


Please assist in creating the corresponding firewall rule. Let us know if any additional information or approvals are required.

Thank you for your help.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Team/Project]

是否要我帮你补全上面的源端、目标格式（比如 source: eks cluster subnet、destination: database endpoint）？这样我可以帮你生成更正式、可直接发出的版本。
